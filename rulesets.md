Qn: how do i set ruleset in Github settings so that collaborators cannot commit unless repo owner approves it? The steps on Github console. My current setting is Ruleset Name: dev_rules Enforcement sttaus: Active Bypass list: Repository admin Targets: by pattern "main", "dev", "prod" (repo has these branches) Branch rules selected: Restrict deletions, Require pull request before merging- Required approvals: 0, and Block force pushes. But somehow collaborators still manage to push commit changes without pull requests!

# Deepseek
It looks like your current ruleset is missing a key restriction: **Restrict updates**. This setting ensures that only users with bypass permissions can push directly to the targeted branches, preventing collaborators from committing changes without a pull request.

Hereâ€™s how you can update your ruleset in GitHub to enforce this:
1. **Go to your repository settings**: Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on **Settings**.
2. **Access Rulesets**: Under **Branches and merges**, find **Rulesets**.
3. **Edit your existing ruleset (`dev_rules`)**:
   - Ensure **Restrict updates** is enabled for the targeted branches (`main`, `dev`, `prod`).
   - Keep **Require pull request before merging** enabled.
   - Set **Required approvals** to at least **1** (this ensures that a pull request must be reviewed before merging).
   - Ensure **Block force pushes** remains enabled.
4. **Save your changes**.

Additionally, check if **repository admins** are bypassing the rules. If you want to enforce this for everyone, remove **Repository admin** from the bypass list.

Try these adjustments, and let me know if collaborators are still able to push directly! ðŸš€

# for the target branches section, it shows 2 branch targeting criteria, - "main", "dev", "prod" - Default Does this Default depends also on my ruleset settings?

Yes, the **Default** targeting criteria in GitHub rulesets typically refers to the repository's default branch, which is usually set to `main` unless changed. This means that if your repository's default branch is `main`, then the **Default** option will automatically apply rules to `main` without needing explicit selection.

However, since you've already specified `"main", "dev", "prod"` as targeted branches, the **Default** setting may not add any additional restrictions unless your ruleset explicitly applies different rules to default branches.

To ensure clarity:
- If your ruleset applies to `"main", "dev", "prod"`, then those branches will follow the configured restrictions.
- If **Default** is selected separately, it will apply rules to the repository's default branch, which might overlap with `main` if it's the default.
- If you want all branches to follow the same rules, keeping both `"main", "dev", "prod"` and **Default** selected should be fine.

Would you like to check your repository settings to confirm which branch is set as default? ðŸš€

# So is it safe to delete Default from Target branches?
Yes, it is generally safe to remove **Default** from the target branches if you have explicitly listed `"main", "dev", "prod"` as your targeted branches. Since **Default** applies to the repository's default branch (which is likely `main` in your case), removing it won't affect the rules applied to `main`, `dev`, and `prod`â€”they will still follow the restrictions you've set.

However, before deleting **Default**, consider:
- **Confirming your default branch**: If your repository's default branch is `main`, then removing **Default** won't change anything.
- **Checking for unintended effects**: If you have other rulesets that rely on **Default**, removing it might impact those rules.
- **Testing the changes**: After removing **Default**, try pushing directly to `main`, `dev`, or `prod` to ensure the ruleset is working as expected.

If everything looks good, go ahead and remove **Default**! ðŸš€ Let me know if you need help verifying your settings.
