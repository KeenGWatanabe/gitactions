## Replacing `main` with `qrcode`, as main is not updating after pull-request from qrcode→main

**No, you don't need a pull request** if you use Option 1 with force push. Here's why:

## What each approach does:

### **Option 1 (force push) - NO pull request needed**
```bash
git checkout main //switch working branch to main
git reset --hard qrcode // all commits in main replace by those in qrcode
git push origin main --force //pushes qrcode to main now
```
- This **directly overwrites** remote main with your branch
- **Bypasses** the need for a pull request
- **Immediate effect** - main is replaced instantly

### **Pull Request approach (alternative)**
If you **want** to use a pull request instead:
```bash
# Push your branch to remote
git push origin qrcode

# Then on GitHub:
# 1. Go to your repo
# 2. Create a Pull Request from qrcode → main
# 3. Merge the PR
```

## Recommendation:

**Use Option 1 with force push** if:
- You're sure the branch should completely replace main
- You want it done immediately
- It's your personal repo or you have permission

**Use Pull Request approach** if:
- You want review/approval process
- It's a team repository
- You want a cleaner audit trail

## So to answer directly:
**No pull request needed** with the force push method. The force push (`--force`) **is** how you update remote main directly.

Which approach would you prefer?
