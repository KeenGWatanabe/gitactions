The `git fetch` command is used to **download updates from a remote repository** (like GitHub) to your local Git repository, **without automatically merging or modifying your local files**. This allows you to review changes before integrating them. Here's how to use it:

---

### **Basic Usage**
1. **Fetch updates from the remote repository**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```
   - This fetches **all branches** from the remote named `origin` (the default name for your remote repository).

2. **Fetch updates for a specific branch** (e.g., `main`):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   ```

---

### **What Happens After Fetching?**
- Git downloads the latest changes (commits, branches, tags) from the remote repository and stores them in your local repository.
- Your **local working files remain untouched** (unlike `git pull`, which merges changes immediately).

---

### **Common Use Cases**

#### 1. **View Remote Changes Before Merging**
   - Fetch updates from the remote:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     ```
   - Compare your local branch with the remote branch (e.g., `main`):
     ```bash
     git diff main origin/main
     ```
   - View new commits on the remote branch:
     ```bash
     git log origin/main
     ```

#### 2. **Merge Remote Changes into Your Local Branch**
   - After fetching, merge the remote branch into your local branch:
     ```bash
     git merge origin/main
     ```
   - This is equivalent to `git pull origin main` (but `pull` = `fetch` + `merge`).

#### 3. **Rebase Your Local Branch**
   - Fetch updates, then rebase your local commits on top of the remote changes:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/main
     ```

#### 4. **Check Out a Remote Branch**
   - Fetch all remote branches, then check out a branch someone else created:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git checkout -b new-feature origin/new-feature
     ```

---

### **Advanced Options**
- **Fetch all remotes**:
  ```bash
  git fetch --all
  ```
- **Fetch tags**:
  ```bash
  git fetch --tags
  ```
- **Prune deleted branches** (remove references to branches deleted on the remote):
  ```bash
  git fetch --prune
  ```

---

### **Example Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Fetch updates from the remote
git fetch origin

# 2. Check what changed (optional)
git log origin/main

# 3. Merge the remote changes into your local branch
git merge origin/main

# 4. Push your changes (if no conflicts)
git push origin main
```

---

### **Key Notes**
- `git fetch` is **safe**â€”it doesnâ€™t alter your local files.
- Use `git pull` if you want to **fetch + merge in one step**.
- Always fetch before pushing to avoid `non-fast-forward` errors (as in your earlier issue).
