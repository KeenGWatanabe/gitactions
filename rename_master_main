The error message you're seeing indicates that you are trying to delete the `master` branch while it is currently checked out. Git does not allow you to delete the branch that you are currently on.

To delete the `master` branch, you need to first switch to a different branch. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Checkout a different branch**: If you have another branch available, switch to it using the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout <other-branch>
   ```

   Replace `<other-branch>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to.

2. **Delete the `master` branch**: Once you are on a different branch, you can delete the `master` branch using:

   ```bash
   git branch -d master
   ```

   If the branch has unmerged changes and you still want to delete it, you can force delete it with:

   ```bash
   git branch -D master
   ```

### Example

Assume you have a branch named `develop`:

```bash
git checkout develop
git branch -d master
```

If `develop` does not exist and you want to create a new branch to switch to:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
git branch -d master
```

This will create a new branch called `new-branch`, switch to it, and then delete the `master` branch.

### Important Note
Deleting the `master` branch is a significant action, especially if it is the default branch in your repository. Make sure that you really want to delete it and that you `have merged any important changes into another branch before doing so`.
