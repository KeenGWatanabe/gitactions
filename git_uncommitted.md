The error occurs because you have uncommitted changes in your working directory (specifically in the `variables.tf` file), and Git cannot proceed with the `git pull` (which involves a merge) without overwriting those changes. To resolve this, you have a few options:

---

### **Option 1: Commit Your Changes**
If you want to keep the changes you've made to `variables.tf`, you can commit them before pulling:

1. **Add the changes to the staging area:**
   ```bash
   git add variables.tf
   ```

2. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message describing the changes"
   ```

3. **Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

4. **Resolve any merge conflicts (if they occur):**
   If there are conflicts between your changes and the remote changes, Git will prompt you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, stage the resolved files and commit the merge:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   git commit
   ```

---

### **Option 2: Stash Your Changes**
If you don't want to commit your changes yet but still want to pull the latest updates, you can stash your changes temporarily:

1. **Stash your local changes:**
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

3. **Reapply your stashed changes:**
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

4. **Resolve any conflicts (if they occur):**
   If there are conflicts between your stashed changes and the pulled changes, Git will notify you. Resolve the conflicts manually, then stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   ```

5. **Commit the changes (if needed):**
   If you resolved conflicts, you may need to commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved conflicts after stash pop"
   ```

---

### **Option 3: Discard Your Local Changes**
If you don't need the changes you've made to `variables.tf` and want to overwrite them with the remote version, you can discard your local changes:

1. **Discard changes to `variables.tf`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -- variables.tf
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

---

### **Option 4: Use `git pull --rebase`**
If you want to pull the latest changes and rebase your local changes on top of them, you can use:

1. **Stash your changes (if needed):**
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. **Pull with rebase:**
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin master
   ```

3. **Reapply your stashed changes:**
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

4. **Resolve conflicts (if any):**
   Resolve any conflicts that arise, then continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

---

### Summary
- **Commit your changes** if you want to keep them.
- **Stash your changes** if you want to temporarily save them and reapply later.
- **Discard your changes** if you don't need them.
- **Rebase** if you want to integrate your changes cleanly on top of the remote changes.
