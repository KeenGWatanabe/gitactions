If your GitHub branch protection rules aren't working as expected, and collaborators can still push directly to the `main` branch despite your settings, here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

---

### **1. Verify Branch Protection Rules**
Go to your repository’s **Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules** and check:
- ✅ **Is `main` branch correctly selected?**  
- ✅ **Are the following restrictions enabled?**  
  - ☑ *Require a pull request before merging*  
  - ☑ *Require approvals* (e.g., at least 1 review)  
  - ☑ *Restrict who can push to matching branches* (if you want only certain users/teams to bypass)  
  - ☑ *Do not allow bypassing the above settings* (important for admins/owners)  

🔹 **If these are set but still not working**, proceed to the next steps.

---

### **2. Check Repository Permissions**
- Go to **Settings > Collaborators & Teams**  
- Ensure collaborators do **not** have **Admin** or **Maintain** permissions (these roles can bypass branch protections).  
- If using **GitHub Organizations**, check **Organization Settings > Repository permissions** to ensure no overriding policies exist.

---

### **3. Check for Bypass Settings**
- Under **Branch protection rules**, ensure:  
  - ❌ *Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests* is **disabled** (unless intentional).  
  - ❌ *Allow administrators to bypass branch protections* is **disabled** (if you want strict enforcement).  

---

### **4. Test with a Non-Admin User**
- Try pushing to `main` as a non-admin collaborator to confirm if the rules are truly not working or if it’s a permissions issue.

---

### **5. GitHub Organization Policies (If Applicable)**
If this is an organization repository:
- Go to **Organization Settings > Policies > Repository Policies**  
- Ensure no **less restrictive** branch protection defaults are overriding your repo settings.

---

### **6. GitHub API/UI Lag (Rare)**
Sometimes GitHub delays applying rules. Try:
- Editing the branch protection rule (toggle a setting off/on).  
- Wait a few minutes and test again.

---

### **7. Check for Custom GitHub Actions**
If you have GitHub Actions workflows with `write` permissions, they might bypass protections. Review:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # This could allow pushes!
```

---

### **8. Still Not Working?**
- **Screenshot your branch protection settings** and share them (redact sensitive info).  
- Run:  
  ```bash
  gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/main/protection
  ```
  (GitHub CLI) to verify API-level enforcement.

---

### **Final Fix**
If all else fails:
1. Temporarily **remove collaborator write access**.  
2. Reapply branch protections.  
3. Re-add collaborators with the correct permissions.
