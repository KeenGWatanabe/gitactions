It appears your Git repository has **corrupted object files**, which is now preventing basic Git operations. Here's how to systematically fix this:

### Step 1: Remove Corrupted Objects
```bash
# Navigate to Git objects
cd ~/nextjs/alifeWSL/.git/objects

# Delete the corrupted files (replace with your actual corrupted paths)
rm -f a9/f9a9dc76669d6f29a20ca826f49ee511c63c45
rm -f c0/7b56b3f5c8aa3fa0447cfd9e3f87c3863989e7
```

### Step 2: Attempt Repository Recovery
```bash
# Return to repo root
cd ~/nextjs/alifeWSL

# Try rebuilding Git's database
git fsck --full
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now
git repack -a -d -l
```

### Step 3: Restore Missing Objects from Remote
```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main  # or origin/prod if needed
```

### Step 4: If Corruption Persists - Reclone
```bash
cd ~/nextjs
mv alifeWSL alifeWSL_backup  # Preserve your work
git clone https://github.com/KeenGWatanabe/alifeWSL.git
cd alifeWSL

# Copy only non-Git files from backup (exclude .git folder)
rsync -av --exclude='.git' ../alifeWSL_backup/ .
```

### Key Notes:
1. **This preserves your uncommitted work** while replacing only the corrupted Git data
2. **For future protection**:
   - Regularly run `git fsck`
   - Avoid interrupting Git operations
   - Consider periodic `git bundle` backups

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail? The corruption appears limited to specific objects, so this should resolve your branch switching issues while preserving your work.
